 * This library provides a simple implementation of printf and sprintf. I wrote
 * it because I could not find a good BSD licensed printf that may be built in
 * to proprietary software.
 *
 * The formats specifiers supported by this implementation are:
 * 'd' 'u' 'x' 'X' 'c' 's'.
 *
 * Zero padding and field width are also supported, as well as pad right and
 * variable pad width.
 *
 * To use printf() your program should provide an implementation of putchar()
 * to output a character, for example:
 *
 * void putchar(char c)
 * {
 *     while(!SERIAL_PORT_EMPTY);
 *     SERIAL_PORT_TX_REGISTER = c;
 * }
 *
 * The code is re-entrant, so it is safe to call from any context, though you
 * will probably get interleaved output. This means that your putchar()
 * function should also be reentrant.
